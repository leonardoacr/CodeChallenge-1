A code challenge I made for a Junior's job opportunity - theme: Brazilian Name Generator. 

This code challenge asked for the following:

You'll have 4 hints about a random Brazilian name and your job is to write a script that tries to find it out.

These are the hints:

- Contains 4 vowels
- Starts with “ma”
- Has 4 syllabes
- One of the syllabes is “di”

I made a full website completely compatible with mobile/desktop to generate names with those hints and a system that takes advantage of a brazilian government database & API to check if the validated names exists on Brazil.
You can check more details on how I made it and the process behind it in README.pdf.
